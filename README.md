# Advent of Code

Repo for my 2021 Advent of code solutions

## Goals

* Use neovim
    * I am becoming more annoyed with vscode, so I want to spend some time in another editor to see if I will like it better
* Don't use php
    * I use php and work and think it is not the future
    * I may use different languages throughout, or the same, not sure
